    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the COVID-19 data dataset and population statistics of countries around the world, the objective is to cluster based on confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, excess mortality, hospital & ICU, policy responses, reproduction rate, tests & positivity, vaccinations, and country statistics, with the goal of finding the relationship between countries and time. The data used represent 67 variables relating to COVID-19, and 376884 observations, where each of them represent one location and date. We will clean them up so that they can be directly used for our purpose, including renaming and clearing up the redundant columns and indices. Then, we will use K-Means and GMM to cluster the data in order to determine relationships between countries, and see how variables interact over time. Dimensional reduction may also be applied to those models, and potentially an evaluation on influence of the factors that might decrease the number of cases. As we are choosing K-Means and GMM as our tools, we will use silhouette score and distortion measure to determine the optional number of clusters."

    "Thus, there has been a great public interest in studying the pandemic, covering its epidemiology, transmission dynamics, clinical manifestations, socio-economic effects, mental health impacts, and the effectiveness of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#who).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work involves lots of dimensions of studies. Previous studies have applied clustering algorithms to COVID-19 data to group countries or regions by similar epidemic characteristics or responses.<a name=\"kucharski\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#kucharski)\n",
    "Research has also used mathematical modeling to help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control.<a name=\"peirlinck\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#peirlinck)\n",
    "Therefore, based on all these prior studies done on COVID-19, we are interested in looking at all the aspects of statistics used in evaluation, which can be clustered into different categories. "

    "\n",
    "* https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data\n",
    "* This dataset contains a total of 376884 rows (observations) × 67 columns (variables)\n",
    "* Each observation consists of information from a given date about the number of cases, deaths, vaccinations, and other data about the population like the number of female and male smokers, diabetes rates, and other statistics.\n",
    "* Some critical variables are:\n",
    "  - “total_cases” -> total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 (includes probable cases)\n",
    "  - “new_cases” -> number of new confirmed cases in a day (includes probable cases)\n",
    "  - “new_cases_smoothed” -> new_cases smoothed over 7 days\n",
    "  - “total_deaths” -> total number of deaths resulting from covid-19 including probable deaths\n",
    "  - “new_deaths” -> number of deaths daily caused by covid-19 in a day\n",
    "  - “new_deaths_smoothed” -> new_deaths smoothed over 7 days\n",
    "  - “excess_mortality” -> difference between predicted number of deaths and actual number of deaths for 2020-2021 by percentage\n",
    "  - “icu_patients” -> number of patients in intensive care units with covid-19 in a day\n",
    "  - “hosp_patients” -> number of patients in hospitals with covid-19 in a day\n",
    "  - “weekly_icu_admissions” -> number of icu patients admitted with covid-19 including patients admitted on recorded date and all 6 days prior\n",
    "  - “weekly_hosp_admissions” -> number of hospital patients admitted with covid-19 including patients admitted on recorded date and all 6 days prior\n",
    "  - “stringency_index” -> value between 0 and 100 measuring strictness of response composed of nine different responses “The nine metrics used to calculate the Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls” (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-stringency-index)\n",
    "  - “reproduction_rate” -> estimate of the reproductive rate of covid-19\n",
    "  - “total_tests” -> total number of covid-19 tests taken\n",
    "  - “total_vaccinations” -> total number of covid-19 vaccinations administered\n",
    "  - “location” -> name of country where observation took place\n",
    "  - “date” -> date of observation in year-month-day format\n",
    "  - “diabetes_prevelance” -> percent of the population between 20-79 with diabetes as of 2017\n",
    "  - “male_smokers”/”female_smokers” -> percent of population that smoke (by sex)\n",
    "* A lot of the data is sparse, so we will need to handle the data points that are missing.  In addition to this, a lot of the data is probably redundant (for example the number of handwashing stations, population…) So in order to handle this we propose having two different data frames.  One data frame to represent each country's more or less unchanging statistics over the course of this four year period and another that contains data that changes over time (number of cases, deaths, number of vaccinations…)\n"

    "\n",
    "Our solution includes using K-Means and GMM to cluster the data in order to determine relationships between countries and also see how variables interact over time. We will compare the two methods to see which is more effective utilizing evaluative metrics. We also hope to compare the effect of dimensionality reduction on these models. We will also attempt a predictive task to try to determine what variables are most influential in decreasing the number of cases."

    "Where:\n",
    "$a$ is the mean distance between a sample and all other points in the same cluster.\n",

    "A higher Silhouette Score implies better clustering.\n",

    "$$ \\text{Distortion} = \\sum^n_{i=1} \\sum^k_{j=1} d(x_i, c_j)^2 $$\n",
    "Where $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point and $c_j$ is the centroid of the $j$-th cluster, and $d$ is the distance between $x_i$ and $c_j$. \n"

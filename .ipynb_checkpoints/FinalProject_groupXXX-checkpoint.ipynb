    "\n",
    "Given the COVID-19 data dataset and population statistics of countries around the world, the objective is to cluster based on confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, excess mortality, hospital & ICU, policy responses, reproduction rate, tests & positivity, vaccinations, and country statistics, with the goal of finding the relationship between countries and time. The data used represent 67 variables relating to COVID-19, and 376884 observations, where each of them represent one location and date. We will clean them up so that they can be directly used for our purpose, including renaming and clearing up the redundant columns and indices. Then, we will use K-Means and GMM to cluster the data in order to determine relationships between countries, and see how variables interact over time. Dimensional reduction may also be applied to those models, and potentially an evaluation on influence of the factors that might decrease the number of cases. As we are choosing K-Means and GMM as our tools, we will use silhouette score and distortion measure to determine the optional number of clusters.\n",
